  <p class="w3-center"><em>"Economics isn’t just something you find in a textbook. It can be a potent tool to right past wrongs and improve 
      people’s lives." - Janet Yellen</em></p>
  <p>Welcome to my website! As an engineer turned economist, my mission is to perform analysis and create tools that aid in righting past wrongs and improving people's lives. 
      The purpose of this site is to show my capabilities through model building, visualization, and forecasting. 
      My resume is posted at the bottom of this page, and in the projects section you can find econometric analysis and my undergrad thesis.

      <p>I started my undergrad career at Penn State's Schreyer Honor's College studying chemical engineering, but fell in love with economics during my 
        first year honors macroeconomics course. That spring, my professor mentioned he was looking for help in his lab group which focused on Game Theory. I'd never heard
        of Game Theory before so I googled it... it was the first time I read a Wikipedia page beginning to end. I applied to the group, excited and full of motivation, but was not accepted. That summer,
        determined not to take no for an answer, I read incessantly. All that I could on Game Theory given my limited budget and time not working, and reapplied in the fall. Long story short, I submitted my 
        disseration on the Tragedy of the Commons 2.5 years later. After graduating from Penn State with a BS in Chemical Engineering and minors in Economics and Mathematics, 
        I went on to work as a derived modeller in the optimization department of ExxonMobil Research and Engineering (EMRE). I created regression 
        based models to help make important decisions regarding crude purchases at site. I liked the job and the people I worked with, but missed Economics research, so I started at
        King's College London pursuing a MSc in Economics and Finance while working in September 2020. </p>

            This graduate dissertation aims to provide evidence for the claim that consumer sentiment is the inverse of 
            economic uncertainty. I use the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment survey as an external instrument for 
            an exogenous shock to economic uncertainty (measured by the VXO) and find that it is a suitable instrument. 
            Additionally, I model a monetary policy shock using an interacted SVAR model, and compare the results to those 
            expected by Chemical Game Theory. The red impulse response functions to left indicate an uncertainty shock
            using the VXO, while those in blue to the right use consumer sentiment as a proxy. Notice that the shapes of the 
            curves are relatively similar for the set of endogenous variables.

            This graph was taken from my undergrad thesis where I was able to analyze a predictive model for the Tragedy of the Commons. 
            My thesis was built on the emerging field of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_game_theory">Chemical Game Theory</a>, in which human decisions are modelled as molecules interacting. Then, 
            through basic chemical engineering principles, I was able to model how people will play the game based on prior dispositions and potential payouts!
            My role was to create tools to analyze games with more than 2 players. Since the number of calculations grows very quickly, practically I was capped at
            10 players, and found a maximum cooperation rate at 4 players.

          Earlier this year (2021) I gave myself a challenge to do in my free-time. Predict next month's inflation, and to show how to do it in a dashboard. 
          I wanted to learn how to use Dash, a powerful dashboard building platform in Python, thoughtfully design a dashboard, apply some of the techniques 
          I was learning in my econometrics course using real data, and deploy it. Since I'm critical of my work and always want to make it better, I limited 
          myself to a week to do it. The results weren't too bad! I got within 0.42% for March CPI data. If you want to learn more about forecasting, or just 
          see the prediction in action, check out <a href="https://arimadash.app">arimadash.app</a> It's educational and interactive, so maybe you can make a better model mine!

          I'm the commissioner of my fantasy basketball league, and so I built this app as a way to faciliate trades throughout the season. Always the topic of fierce debate, whether a 
          trade is 'fair' or not can now be statistically analyzed, and if there is not significant evidence that the averages are unequal (using a two sample t test), the trade may pass. 
          Additionally, the tool may be used to analyze trends and determine which players are performing above or below their rolling means.
